It is used as a reinforcing agent for many polymer products; the resulting composite material, properly known as fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) or glass-reinforced plastic (GRP), is called \"fiberglass\" in popular usage. Glassmakers throughout history have experimented with glass fibers, but mass manufacture of fiberglass was only made possible with the invention of finer machine tooling. In 1893, Edward Drummond Libbey exhibited a dress at the World's Columbian Exposition incorporating glass fibers with the diameter and texture of silk fibers. This was first worn by the popular stage actress of the time Georgia Cayvan.\n\nWhat is commonly known as \"fiberglass\" today, however, was invented in 1938 by Russell Games Slayter of Owens-Corning as a material to be used as insulation. It is marketed under the trade name Fiberglas, which has become a generalized trademark. A somewhat similar, but more expensive technology used for applications requiring very high strength and low weight is the use of carbon fiber.\n\nOur local manufacturers of Pakistan have a great standard in there production and we are coming up with new innovations and ideas for the industry inshaAllah in few years Pakistan will become the No.1 FIBERGLASS Manufacturer in the Globe.", "company_img": null, "company_url": "http://www.linkedin.com/company/2623779?trk=vsrp_companies_res_photo&trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A4471217271467694119711%2CVSRPtargetId%3A2623779%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary", "company_logo": "http://m.c.lnkd.licdn.com/media/p/4/000/173/3f6/0b73629.png", "company_type": "Privately Held", "company_founded": null, "company_name": "FIBER WORKS PAKISTAN", "company_industy": "Arts and Crafts", "key": "877371395@qq.com", "company_headquarters": "Shop #1, Plot #L-426 opp. Jamia Masjid Azizia Near 2minute Stop Sector 5-A-4, North Karachi Karachi, Sindh Pakistan", "company_size": "Myself Only"}

We help make the agricultural economy more productive thus contributing to society by helping to ensure an ample supply of high-quality food, feed, fiber and renewable raw materials.\n\nThe opportunities and challenges driving the global agricultural community are complex and daunting. A growing world population, changing dietary habits and volatile weather – to name just a few – are affecting agricultural production today and in the future. How can we increase productivity and achieve food security for what will be close to 10 billion people by 2050? How can we help plants thrive in changing climatic conditions? How can we best support the growers, from subsistence farmers to large-scale farming operations? And how can we assure that only high-quality and safe food reaches the consumer? We are committed to helping tackle these challenges through our expertise in high value seeds, innovative chemical and biological crop protection solutions, and services for modern, sustainable agriculture. \n\nAddressing some of the major challenges in modern agriculture requires fresh answers. A higher stress-tolerance of plants in face of increasing weather volatility will be as important as developing innovative solutions to control pests, plant diseases and weeds. Consequently, we invest approximately 10 percent of our annual sales in R&D, roughly 850 million Euros in 2012.

The money should go to build a hospital and a university of the highest stature in the heart of Baltimore, Md., a place where all patients—rich or poor, black or white, male or female—could receive care.\n\nFrom the institution’s beginnings in 1876, Hopkins leaders have understood that to practice medicine, young physicians need frontline training alongside veteran physicians whose knowledge and experience provides the best means of fighting disease. Our faculty believes that to best grasp illness, our student-physicians must also understand the patients who are afflicted and constantly be searching for better treatments, newer answers and greater ideas.

Pitt evolved into the Western University of Pennsylvania with an alteration to its charter in 1819, and upon relocating to its current campus in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh in 1908, the school received its current moniker, the University of Pittsburgh. For most of its history, Pitt was a private institution until it became part of the Commonwealth System of Higher Education in 1966.\nPitt's rise from its humble frontier beginnings to its current stature is due in part to its ability to withstand early pressures to abandon its commitment to liberal education. Along the way Pitt has achieved strong reputations in a variety of academic disciplines including philosophy, physics, astronomy, history of science, English literature, creative writing, chemistry, business, biological sciences, information sciences, jazz, engineering, education, international studies, and a variety of medical and health sciences.

CBRAM is different from other emerging memories in that it can be customized to serve a wide range of applications.  As a standalone memory, commercial CBRAM products have inherent advantages over competitive non-volatile memories. Its advantages include ultra low-energy consumption and ultra-fast write capabilities, making it a natural fit for Internet of Things, Wearables, and other energy-conscious applications. In addition, Adesto has licensed its technology as an embedded memory to several large SOC (System on Chip) Semiconductor companies and thus enabled them to develop a future roadmap without limitations. \n\n\nUnlike other memory technologies, CBRAM is completely CMOS compatible and through optimizations of the memory cell, its architecture, and the manufacturing process it can be shown to be extremely versatile in the way it operates. Adesto released its first CBRAM-based memory devices in 2012 and now offers commerical CBRAM-serial memory product selections, targeting the $5B non-volatile EEPROM and NOR Flash markets.\n\nIn September 2012, Adesto expanded the company’s value-added memory business by acquiring Atmel’s DataFlash and Serial Flash product lines. Since the acquisition, Adesto has enhanced its Serial Flash lines by bringing to market new, low voltage, feature-rich products. These products deliver to customers high quality Serial Flash solutions which help designers to extend battery life, reduce system power, and reduce overall system costs.", "company_img": "http://m.c.lnkd.licdn.com/media/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAe4AAAAJGE0YTg4NjYyLWEyNGQtNGUzNC04Mjc3LTNhYTY3YTJmMDYyZA.png", "company_url": "http://www.linkedin.com/company/3092167?trk=vsrp_companies_res_photo&trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A4471217271468479762956%2CVSRPtargetId%3A3092167%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary", "company_logo": "http://m.c.lnkd.licdn.com/media/p/7/005/015/2fc/1c3caf1.png", "company_type": "Public Company", "company_founded": "2007", "company_name": "Adesto Technologies", "company_industy": "Semiconductors", "key": "877371395@qq.com", "company_headquarters": "1250 Borregas Ave Sunnyvale, CA 94089 United States", "company_size": "51-200 employees"}

The study is enrolling patients with advanced hematologic and solid malignancies who test positive for the presence of wild-type p53. The objectives of the trial include determining maximum tolerated/optimal biological dose, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics (including showing the re-activation of p53) and preliminary indications of anti-tumor activity.  The trial initiated in November 2014 with dose escalating cohorts continuing to advance in 2015.  \n\nALRN-6924 binds equipotently and inhibits both of the p53 suppressor proteins, MDM2 and MDMX.  Several reports have shown that inhibiting MDMX can overcome resistance to MDM2 inhibitors and enhance anti-cancer activity. \n\nAileron’s drug platform stabilizes peptides by ‘‘stapling’’ them with a hydrocarbon-based bridge into an α-helix, a structure peptides naturally employ to interact with other peptides or proteins. The stapled peptides are then able to inhibit intracellular protein–protein interactions, nearly all of which have been undruggable with small molecule or protein-based therapeutics.\n\nThe Company believes its stapled α -helical peptides have wide therapeutic potential for cancer, autoimmune, inflammatory, infectious, and metabolic diseases.", "company_img": null, "company_url": "http://www.linkedin.com/company/508770?trk=vsrp_companies_res_photo&trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A4471217271468483188811%2CVSRPtargetId%3A508770%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary", "company_logo": "http://m.c.lnkd.licdn.com/media/p/3/000/059/3c1/0d868da.png", "company_type": "Privately Held", "company_founded": "2005", "company_name": "Aileron Therapeutics", "company_industy": "Pharmaceuticals", "key": "877371395@qq.com", "company_headquarters": "281 Albany Street Cambridge, MA 02139 United States", "company_size": "11-50 employees"}

Our products often enable our customers to use lightweight, high-performance composites in applications where they previously have not been able to. \n\nOne of the great benefits of using composites to replace metal components is related to fuel efficiency.

API has completed over 500 energy and water integration studies and identified annual energy savings opportunities of over one billion dollars. API boasts the world’s largest experience list for the application of Pinch technology to industry.\n\nSince 2005, the company has been developing technologies for the conversion of biomass into cellulosic sugars to be used in the production of biofuels and biobased chemicals. American Process owns two patented cellulosic technologies, Green Power+® and AVAP®.\nOur GreenPower+® technology produces low cost cellulosic sugars by extracting only hemicelluloses from biomass. The rest of the biomass is used downstream for the production of renewable power, pellets, wood or pulp products. The technology is feedstock agnostic, and can work with hardwood, softwood, bagasse and other agricultural residue.\n\nOur AVAP® technology produces low cost pure cellulosic sugars by converting all the cellulose and hemicelluloses of biomass to cellulosic sugars. These sugars can then be converted or fermented by bacteria or yeast in to bio-based chemicals and biofuels.\n\nFurthermore, we have developed a single, cost-effective IP protected process for production of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) and cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) along with novel, hydrophobic, lignin coated versions of each. With our AVAP® Biorefinery pretreatment technology, these cellulose nanomaterials are produced from woody or non-woody biomass at a fraction of the cost for competing nanocellulose production processes.\n\nOur Company envisions the development of a sustainable global economy where “Sugar is the New Crude ®”.", "company_img": "http://m.c.lnkd.licdn.com/media/p/3/005/052/05a/3bc04b5.png", "company_url": "http://www.linkedin.com/company/1690991?trk=vsrp_companies_res_photo&trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A4471217271468569884675%2CVSRPtargetId%3A1690991%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary", "company_logo": "http://m.c.lnkd.licdn.com/media/p/1/005/052/07a/34cd5d1.png", "company_type": "Privately Held", "company_founded": "1994", "company_name": "American Process Inc", "company_industy": "Mechanical or Industrial Engineering", "key": "877371395@qq.com", "company_headquarters": "750 Piedmont Ave. NE Atlanta, GA 30308 United States", "company_size": "51-200 employees"}

Approximately 200,000 people are newly diagnosed each year. Open surgical repair of aortic aneurysms, a treatment option practiced for decades, has high procedure related mortality rates & long patient recovery times. However, open surgical repair provides patients with a durable treatment requiring little to no follow-up or need for re-interventions. EVAR, which has been in practice since the 1990’s, is a minimally invasive catheter based AAA treatment with significantly reduced procedure related mortality & patient recovery time- but requires annual monitoring and may need additional interventions in the years after treatment. \n\nWe are focused on developing innovative technologies to transform EVAR, empowering physicians to perform minimally invasive aneurysm repair while still providing the control & potential long term durability of open surgery. Our initial product offering is an innovative helical anchor technology—the Heli-FX EndoAnchor System (commercially available in the US & EU). The advent of our EndoAnchor System pioneers a new endovascular capability with potential applications beyond AAA repair.\n\nSystem Components:\nHeli-FX Guide\n▪ Different deflected tip reach lengths address varying neck diameters\n▪ Radiopaque tip markers provide 3D orientation of guide tip\nHeli-FX Applier\n▪ Two-stage EndoAnchor deployment allows placement confirmation and repositioning\n▪ EndoAnchor Cassette with 10 EndoAnchors packaged in sterile cassette\nAncillary EndoAnchor Cassette\n▪ Provides an additional 5 EndoAnchors packaged in a sterile cassette\n▪ Addresses needs of more complex procedures, which require greater than 10 EndoAnchors", "company_img": "http://m.c.lnkd.licdn.com/media/p/8/005/025/3ad/07fc26e.png", "company_url": "http://www.linkedin.com/company/73106?trk=vsrp_companies_res_photo&trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A4471217271468574806861%2CVSRPtargetId%3A73106%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary", "company_logo": "http://m.c.lnkd.licdn.com/media/p/6/005/025/3ad/09f2044.png", "company_type": "Privately Held", "company_founded": null, "company_name": "Aptus Endosystems", "company_industy": "Medical Devices", "key": "877371395@qq.com", "company_headquarters": "United States", "company_size": "51-200 employees"}

Auray and Neil G. Hayes in 1925 as The Bridgeport Switch Company. Initially, the product line consisted of electrical switches, bells, buzzers, wall switches and receptacles.\n\nThe company shifted manufacturing direction in 1936, when it was decided to emphasize conduit and cable fittings for the electrical industry. Malleable iron, steel, aluminum and brass fittings replaced the original residential electrical components. Later, in 1948, the company changed its name to Bridgeport Fittings, Inc.\n\nContinued new product development, coupled with the company's desire to be the market leader in quality conduit fittings, led to the introduction of two zinc die-cast products in 1958. Those products included the 3/8\" BX and Romex connectors that remain popular today. As manufacturing and marketing growth progressed, the need for an even larger facility became apparent, thus the move of Bridgeport Fittings, Inc. to its current location in Stratford, Connecticut., nearby Bridgeport.\n\nIn 2006 Bridgeport Fittings purchased certain assets of Regal Manufacturing including the Regal name, patents, drawings, trademarks and tools and dies associated with the manufacture of Regal products. This acquisition further strengthened Bridgeport’s market position within the electrical industry and reconfirmed the company’s commitment to be the best in category manufacturer to the industry. Today, the Bridgeport Fittings line includes over 2000 products.", "company_img": null, "company_url": "http://www.linkedin.com/company/140362?trk=vsrp_companies_res_photo&trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A4471217271468830836451%2CVSRPtargetId%3A140362%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary", "company_logo": "http://m.c.lnkd.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrink_200_200/AAEAAQAAAAAAAATqAAAAJDc0Y2NmZDQxLWFmYzYtNGNhYi05NGZmLWZiMDFkMTYwYmM5MQ.png", "company_type": "Privately Held", "company_founded": "1925", "company_name": "Bridgeport Fittings, Inc.", "company_industy": "Electrical/Electronic Manufacturing", "key": "877371395@qq.com", "company_headquarters": "705 Lordship Blvd. Stratford, CT 06615 United States", "company_size": "201-500 employees"}
