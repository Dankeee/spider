It is used as a reinforcing agent for many polymer products; the resulting composite material, properly known as fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) or glass-reinforced plastic (GRP), is called \"fiberglass\" in popular usage. Glassmakers throughout history have experimented with glass fibers, but mass manufacture of fiberglass was only made possible with the invention of finer machine tooling. In 1893, Edward Drummond Libbey exhibited a dress at the World's Columbian Exposition incorporating glass fibers with the diameter and texture of silk fibers. This was first worn by the popular stage actress of the time Georgia Cayvan.\n\nWhat is commonly known as \"fiberglass\" today, however, was invented in 1938 by Russell Games Slayter of Owens-Corning as a material to be used as insulation. It is marketed under the trade name Fiberglas, which has become a generalized trademark. A somewhat similar, but more expensive technology used for applications requiring very high strength and low weight is the use of carbon fiber.\n\nOur local manufacturers of Pakistan have a great standard in there production and we are coming up with new innovations and ideas for the industry inshaAllah in few years Pakistan will become the No.1 FIBERGLASS Manufacturer in the Globe.", "company_img": null, "company_url": "http://www.linkedin.com/company/2623779?trk=vsrp_companies_res_photo&trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A4471217271467694119711%2CVSRPtargetId%3A2623779%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary", "company_logo": "http://m.c.lnkd.licdn.com/media/p/4/000/173/3f6/0b73629.png", "company_type": "Privately Held", "company_founded": null, "company_name": "FIBER WORKS PAKISTAN", "company_industy": "Arts and Crafts", "key": "877371395@qq.com", "company_headquarters": "Shop #1, Plot #L-426 opp. Jamia Masjid Azizia Near 2minute Stop Sector 5-A-4, North Karachi Karachi, Sindh Pakistan", "company_size": "Myself Only"}

We help make the agricultural economy more productive thus contributing to society by helping to ensure an ample supply of high-quality food, feed, fiber and renewable raw materials.\n\nThe opportunities and challenges driving the global agricultural community are complex and daunting. A growing world population, changing dietary habits and volatile weather – to name just a few – are affecting agricultural production today and in the future. How can we increase productivity and achieve food security for what will be close to 10 billion people by 2050? How can we help plants thrive in changing climatic conditions? How can we best support the growers, from subsistence farmers to large-scale farming operations? And how can we assure that only high-quality and safe food reaches the consumer? We are committed to helping tackle these challenges through our expertise in high value seeds, innovative chemical and biological crop protection solutions, and services for modern, sustainable agriculture. \n\nAddressing some of the major challenges in modern agriculture requires fresh answers. A higher stress-tolerance of plants in face of increasing weather volatility will be as important as developing innovative solutions to control pests, plant diseases and weeds. Consequently, we invest approximately 10 percent of our annual sales in R&D, roughly 850 million Euros in 2012.

The money should go to build a hospital and a university of the highest stature in the heart of Baltimore, Md., a place where all patients—rich or poor, black or white, male or female—could receive care.\n\nFrom the institution’s beginnings in 1876, Hopkins leaders have understood that to practice medicine, young physicians need frontline training alongside veteran physicians whose knowledge and experience provides the best means of fighting disease. Our faculty believes that to best grasp illness, our student-physicians must also understand the patients who are afflicted and constantly be searching for better treatments, newer answers and greater ideas.

Chartered in 1787, Pitt is highly regarded in academic fields ranging from philosophy to medicine, and is well known for the development of the first Polio vaccine as well as its landmark centerpiece building, the Cathedral of Learning.\n\nFounded as Pittsburgh Academy in 1787 on what was then the American frontier, Pitt is one of the oldest continuously chartered institutions of higher education in the United States. Pitt evolved into the Western University of Pennsylvania with an alteration to its charter in 1819, and upon relocating to its current campus in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh in 1908, the school received its current moniker, the University of Pittsburgh. For most of its history, Pitt was a private institution until it became part of the Commonwealth System of Higher Education in 1966.\nPitt's rise from its humble frontier beginnings to its current stature is due in part to its ability to withstand early pressures to abandon its commitment to liberal education. Along the way Pitt has achieved strong reputations in a variety of academic disciplines including philosophy, physics, astronomy, history of science, English literature, creative writing, chemistry, business, biological sciences, information sciences, jazz, engineering, education, international studies, and a variety of medical and health sciences.
