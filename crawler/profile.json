Functionally, I've built full consumer-facing sites, API servers, telecom application infrastructure, and mobile applications. I've used a fair number of javascript client frameworks for web (although I still consider CSS a black black art)... for mobile MVP's I like the idea of native wrappers around web frameworks (i.e., cordova/phonegap + native iOS/Android plugins in Objective C / Java or react native). It's quick to set up and lets the product side iterate using existing web technology resources.
